<Warning>
We strongly advise upgrading to this latest version of Unikraft in order to
continue to be compatible with future versions.
In our accompanying blog post we include necessary [migration steps](https://unikraft.org/blog/2024-01-17-unikraft-releases-v0.16.1).
Additionally, we have released [a new version of KraftKit (v0.7.2)](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/releases/tag/v0.7.2) which already incorporates an understanding these changes and have upgraded all images in the [Unikraft Community Catalog](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) of pre-built unikernel images.
