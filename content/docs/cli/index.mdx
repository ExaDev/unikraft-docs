title: Unikraft CLI Companion Tool
description: |
  Unikraft's companion command-line tool `kraft` has been modeled after many
  popular package managers and build tools with the explicit aim of making it
  easy to build and manage your application as a unikernel.
---

Before beginning, it is important to familiarize yourself with [the concept of a
unikernel](/docs/concepts/) and how unikernels differ from other runtime
mediums, including: containers, standard VMs and OSes (e.g. Linux).  At the same
time, a general understanding of [how a unikernel is constructed with
Unikraft](/docs/internals/build-process) will help you understand how to use
`kraft` effectively.

Please let us know if you run into any issues [by reaching out through one of
the main communication channels](#) or by filing an [issue on GitHub](#). Happy
krafting! üêí

## Quick-start example based on `qemu/x86_64`

Start by using the interactive installer:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.kraftkit.sh | sh
```

This will install the `kraft` binary executable onto your host as well as
additional dependencies necessary for building and running Unikraft unikernels.
The installer detects your OS and suggests an appropriate installation
procedure.

<Info>
For more information on customizing your installation of `kraft`, please refer
to the [complete installation guide](/docs/cli/install).
</Info>

To test your installation, you can try running our pre-built "Hello, World"
unikernel on your machine by simply invoking the following command:

```
kraft run unikraft.org/helloworld:latest
```

If all goes well, you should be greeted with a message and some helpful tips.
If things didn't go well, please check out our [troubleshooting guide](#) for
more information and for frequently asked questions.

```
kraft -h
```
```txt nocopy=true

    .
   /^\     Build and use highly customized and ultra-lightweight unikernels.
