title: Welcome to Unikraft's Documentation ðŸ‘‹
description: |
  Unikraft is a fast, secure and open-source Unikernel Development Kit which
  enables you to build custom, minimal, immutable ultra-lightweight unikernel
  virtual machines quickly and easily.
---

This documentation is organized into guides for operators of Unikraft unikernels
who wish to run ultra-lightweight VMs; developers who wish to package
pre-existing applications into a unikernel; and, hackers, researchers and staff
who wish to extend Unikraft itself.

## Overview

Unikraft is a compile-time specialization strategy and alternative system for
running your application compared to containers or traditional VMs as it allows
you to completely customize the OS/kernel which facilitates the runtime of your
application.  There are many benefits in running your application as a
unikernel: for more information about [the performance
advantages](/docs/concepts/performance) ðŸš€, [the added
security](/docs/concepts/security) ðŸ”’ and a [positive impact on the
environment](/docs/concepts/efficiency) ðŸŒ± please check out the [introductory
concept chapters](/docs/concepts).

The Unikraft ecosystem consists of an extensive build system and tooling,
libraries and pre-built unikernel applications.  All of the source code is
open-source and licensed under `BSD-3-Clause` (contributions welcome!).  As an
active community, we host regular working groups, hackathons, meetups and more.

## Quick-start

To get started building and using Unikraft, you can use [the companion
command-line tool `kraft`](/docs/cli), allowing you to easily leverage Unikraft
unikernels at every stage of their lifecycle, from construction to production:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.kraftkit.sh | sh
```

See [alternative installation methods](/docs/cli/install) and [CLI usage
instructions](/docs/cli).
